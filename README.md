The total time spent is not very accurate as the first ~4 months of this project, no timer was set. The total time spent spent is closer to 300 hours spent. 
## What this Repository contains
This repository contains my A-level Computer Science coursework. It includes the complete source code for the application and the suplementary report that accompanies it. This README contains the report and the source code can be found above. 

**It should be noted that the report in the README does contain the original source code for the application. This is because submission requires the source-code to be present.**

## Summary 
The following project `2B NOR !2B` is an application to aid students in their studies of GCSE and A-Level computer science. The application specifically covers the units of logic gates and boolean expressions within the course specifications. The program features: 
- Automatic logic gate diagram drawing from a user entered boolean expression.
- Automatic truth table generation either from an entered boolean expression or from the previously drawn logic gate diagram.
- Interactive logic gate diagrams, where the wires reflect the output states of each component in the diagram. This allows students to construct logic gate diagrams and then see how binary signals are transmitted throughout the diagram and how that affects the output.
- Logic diagram and Boolean expression simplification using the Quine-McCluskey Algorithm and Petrik's method.
- Pop-up menus enabling the students to quickly find information about each logic gate within the diagram.
- LATEX rendering using the [xaml-math](https://github.com/ForNeVeR/xaml-math) repository to display expressions as they should be written in exam situations.
- File-handling to enable users to save, load and export diagrams produced by the application.


# Report 
Below is the report written for this project, it details along the entire process of developing, testing and evaluation of the application. The source code is also included in the report as mentioned previously.
