## Features
- [ ] Drawing grid lines on the main canvas.
- [ ] Making the grid resizable. 
### Drawing diagrams from expressions 
- [x] Added labels to the inputs
- [ ] Adjust formulae so that the components are placed onto the grid.
- [ ] Adjust formulae for odd shaped graphs
- [ ] Repeated inputs within expressions are not drawn
- [ ] Wires are stored within the node objects (useful for repositioning nodes)
- [ ] Add outputs to the drawn diagrams.
### making compnents interactive
- [ ] wires change colours based off of input node states. 
- [ ] Input pins show their state with a label
- [ ] Gates change the state of wires.
- [ ] Output pins displays the states of wires
### Drawing diagrams through drag and drop
- [ ] Clicking side menu adds component to the canvas
- [ ] dragging the component follows the grid lines.
- [ ] Wires will draw intersections if one is drawn over the other.
- [ ] Drawn wires will follow the grid lines. 
### Other features
- [ ] carrying out traversal on drawn diagram to produce a boolean expression
- [ ] Generating truth tables from drawn diagrams (find the expression and then produce table)
- [ ] Scroll view for generated tables that are too large.
- [ ] Minimising expressions and diagrams (Quine-Mclusky and Karnaugh maps)
- [ ] Help pages detailing how the program works with markdown formatting.
- [ ] Saving drawn diagrams in custom XML format. `Serialisation`
- [ ] Exporting a trimmed version of the canvas with diagrams (optional truth table included).
- [ ] Loading in the cuustom XML format. `Deserialisation`
