### Todo
diagram drawing 
- [ ] offset of the vertical wires for the repeated input case
- [ ] draw circles in connected wires 
- [ ] draw circular brigdes for wires. 
- [ ] make the inputs smaller and square. 
- [ ] redo sprite for the output pin 
- [ ] diagrams can be created only with NAND and NOR, (ask for this with a dialog)

diagram interactivity
- [ ] inputs and outputs display the state that they are currently storing 
- [x] wires display the state of the child component that is connected to them 

truth tables 
- [ ] ?trim excess brackets from headers to reduce length and produce more visually appealing tables. 

minimisation 
- [ ] ensure the boolean function is completely covered by the essential prime and prime implicant. 
- [ ] Reformat the brackets with expressions 
- [ ] write a display for the minimisation code. Showing the implicants etc. 

odd jobs 
- [ ] write the help pages for the program 
- [ ] redesign the main window for a more appealing side panel (key with the gates) 
- [ ] display expression with LATEX, could render expressions as user is typing. 
- [ ] Exporting drawn diagrams and truth tables. (option for both with a dialog), must crop properly
- [ ] Increase size and readability of the dialogs. 
- [ ] Customisation menu (year group selection) to change visuals for the type of user. 
- [ ] Add a scroll viewer so that much larger tables and diagrams can be viewed more easily. 
- [ ] ?functionality for diagrams with multiple inputs. 
- [ ] Inputs do not have to be sequential within entered expressions. 
- [ ] Add a application picture for the application.
